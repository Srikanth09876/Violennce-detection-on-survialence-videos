The person motion analysis has become the center of video processing, especially in motion detection and security surveillance, in recent years. When performing specific research work, it is always a tool to minimize human resources. However, earlier recognition methods often extract descriptors around spatiotemporal attention points or extract statistical features of motion regions, resulting in limited ability to effectively identify video-based violence. In this research work, we proposed a Convolutional Neural Network, where the video stream is sent to the Convolutional Neural Network together with a single shot detector to detect violence and objects in the video. In addition, if a violent incident is detected, an alert will be issued to the respective departments. The proposed model may be very useful in certain surveillance scenarios like prisons, psychiatric hospitals, etc.  In real time, we can able to detect the violence activities also.​

1)In this era of technology, we using several smart devices in our daily life. But we are a little bit away from monitoring real-time crime and its solution. I continue noticing several criminal activities video in social media where a single person put someone gunpoint and take everything from the victim inside of CCTV cameras.​

2) In this case, CCTV does not work or give a real-time effect because of its only capture video for further use. This thing inspired me to make something new which would solve this problem and gives a real-time solution. And finally, I decided to develop a model which could detect real-time violence/crime through pre-installed CCTV and alert the nearest officer/authorised person who could take further action immediately. ​

3)Using AI in a smart surveillance system is a big part of the Smart City solution. In addition, there is very less research over this topic that thing also increase my interest. ​
